# Deep Doctor: Neural Networks in Medical Diagnostics

Deep Doctor was a piece of research work completed as my final year undergraduate dissertation. It looked into the viability of various deep convolutional neural network architectures in diagnosing human chest X-rays.

The resultant work can be viewed and downloaded [here](https://github.com/Kaapp/Deep-Doctor/blob/master/dissertation.pdf)
